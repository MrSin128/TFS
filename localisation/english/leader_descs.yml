POLITICS_Farouk_I_DESC:0 "Farouk is the current ruler of Egypt and Sudan, being watched and puppeted by the British and Italians, he is the 10th ruler under the Muhammad Ali Dynasty. His rule is quite limited and almost placebo at this point as his country's entire economy and trade is being filtered and controlled by the controlling countries over him.
But Farouk does not care what happens to export and import, he cares only that he is the ruler, which is starting to upset most Egyptians, but Farouk doesn’t care, in fact, he started hating them back, which is slowly starting the decline and collapse of the Kingdom of Egypt, which is only beneficial for Britain and Italy."
POLITICS_Siegfried_Muller_DESC:0 "Siegfried Müller was a former Wehrmacht officer during the German invasion of Poland. Müller immigrated to southern Africa after the war and became a candidate for the governor-general for the colony of German Mittel Afrika, with his Military experience and citizenship in Africa, he was the obvious choice.
Now Siegfried stays surprisingly neutral, trying to stay afloat in the anarchy that is Africa, with Britain, Egypt, Portugal, and the anarcho-tribal system of unorganized clans surrounding him, it is clear that it will only take a small amount of pressure for him to crack."
POLITICS_Charles_Arden_Clarke_DESC:0 "Who was once a British colonial administrator, to being governor-general of Ghana, to now being governor of one of the largest colonies in Africa. It is safe to say Sir Charles Arden-Clark has had quite an ambitious political career. He had many former leadership positions in British-owned land, but this will be his first paramount position. He is now appointed as the West African mandate's governor.
He has to fix a multitude of issues within Western Africa, if he does not deal with them in due time, a rebellion could spark and cause a collapse in the colony."
POLITICS_Amedeo_Giovani_DESC:0 "Prince Amadeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta, is the current Viceroy of Italian East Africa, before his position he led the troops in the Italian campaign on Eastern Africa, which includes, Ethiopia, Djibouti, and Eritrea, they surrendered quickly due to the lack of munitions and trained men.
Now Prince Amadeo sits on his throne at the horn of Africa, comfortably, with some worry. Besides the Italian owned Algeria, he is stranded in Africa, directly bordering the kingdom of Egypt and lining the Suez."
