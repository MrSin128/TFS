POLITICS_Farouk_I_DESC:0 "Farouk is the current ruler of Egypt and Sudan, being watched and puppeted by the British and Italians, he is the 10th ruler under the Muhammad Ali Dynasty. His rule is quite limited and almost placebo at this point as his country's entire economy and trade is being filtered and controlled by the controlling countries over him.\n\nBut Farouk does not care what happens to export and import, he cares only that he is the ruler, which is starting to upset most Egyptians, but Farouk doesn’t care, in fact, he started hating them back, which is slowly starting the decline and collapse of the Kingdom of Egypt, which is only beneficial for Britain and Italy.

POLITICS_Siegfried_Muller_DESC:0 "Siegfried Müller was a former Wehrmacht officer during the German invasion of Poland. Müller immigrated to southern Africa after the war and became a candidate for the governor-general for the colony of German Mittel Afrika, with his Military experience and citizenship in Africa, he was the obvious choice.\n\nNow Siegfried stays surprisingly neutral, trying to stay afloat in the anarchy that is Africa, with Britain, Egypt, Portugal, and the anarcho-tribal system of unorganized clans surrounding him, it is clear that it will only take a small amount of pressure for him to crack."
POLITICS_Charles_Arden_Clarke_DESC:0 "Who was once a British colonial administrator, to being governor-general of Ghana, to now being governor of one of the largest colonies in Africa. It is safe to say Sir Charles Arden-Clark has had quite an ambitious political career. He had many former leadership positions in British-owned land, but this will be his first paramount position. He is now appointed as the West African mandate's governor. \n\nHe has to fix a multitude of issues within Western Africa, if he does not deal with them in due time, a rebellion could spark and cause a collapse in the colony."
POLITICS_Amedeo_Giovani_DESC:0 "Prince Amadeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta, is the current Viceroy of Italian East Africa, before his position he led the troops in the Italian campaign on Eastern Africa, which includes, Ethiopia, Djibouti, and Eritrea, they surrendered quickly due to the lack of munitions and trained men.\n\nNow Prince Amadeo sits on his throne at the horn of Africa, comfortably, with some worry. Besides the Italian owned Algeria, he is stranded in Africa, directly bordering the kingdom of Egypt and lining the Suez."
POLITICS_James_Wilson_Robertson_DESC:0 "James Wilson Robertson is the current Governor-General of the colonial state of Nigeria, he got his degree in England and shortly afterward joined the Sudanese Political Service as the civil secretary until his promotion in 1955 to the governor-general, his time in the position has so far been a short and uneventful one, but that is all he can hope for being in the complete chaos that is Africa, even as a British colony he must watch his every move, if not, he might not keep stability in our times."
POLITICS_Hilary_Blood_DESC:0 "In 1920, Hilary Blood entered the Ceylon Civil Service, serving for a full decade before becoming colonial secretary for Grenada and Sierra Leone, in 1942 he became governor of the Gambia, his first of many roles, shortly after becoming governor for Mauritius and Barbados. The former governor of Mauritius, Barbados, and the Gambia until the late 1940s had received quite the promotion as the Governor-General of the West African Mandate from the royal family, being one of the biggest and most influential territories in Africa, the complete chaos surrounding him can only make things worse, it is unclear the safety of the large colony and whether they can keep peace within our times."
POLITICS_Percy_Wyn_Harris_DESC:0 "In 1926 Percy Wyn-Harris joined the Colonial Service in Kenya. After being shifted around Africa filling in many different and vast positions he was appointed Governor-General of the Gambia in 1949, Gambia has been seen as a strong supporter of administration from the United Kingdom, never particularly striving towards self-governance as so many other countries in Africa have in the past. It’s unclear whether this will keep the Gambian population happy with not only Percy, but the British state, some smell an uprising brewing."
POLITICS_James_Wilson_Robertson_DESC:0 "Dorman was recently appointed Governor-General of Sierra Leone as soon as the colony was founded, with prior experience representing the royal family all across British colonies; it was a wise decision giving him control of the state. Dorman has not publicly stated many of his future plans with Sierra Leone, and most of the population is fine with that, out of all of the countries trying to survive in Africa, Sierra Leone is one of if not the most well off of them."
