 POLITICS_ITALO_BALBO_DESC:0 "Italo Balbo was the heir of Mussolini and now the current Il Duce of Italy and leader of the Italian Blackshirts. During Mussolini's rule he was Marshall of the Air Force and Governor of Libya and other regions of Italian North-Africa. He played a huge role in developing Mussolini's Air Force and was very close to the now deceased leader, Balbo is very patriotic and a proud Fascist, so he was very eager to step in the role his close friend left behind for him.\n\nBalbo has been a popular figurehead in Italy, many Italian Fascists and Catholic churches support him due to his anti-communist and anti-Nazi stance. But Balbo’s health has only gone downhill, leaving the future of Italy still largely unknown."
