 POLITICS_GEORGIOS_PAPADOPOPOULOS_DESC:0 "Georgios Papadopoulos was a former officer during World War 2. And after the defeat of the Allies, he became the leader of the Hellenic State under the support of Italy. He made the economy flourish under tourism and exports. However almost every other party wishes for Greece to be independent, and with the growing rise of Communism, it is hard for even Papadopoulos to predict what happens next."
