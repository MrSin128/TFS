 POLITICS_SEPP_JANKO_DESC:0 "Sepp Janko is a Serbian SS and a former Obersturmführer. He was appointed by the German government as the governor of Banat. As the only SS state in the German sphere, the German government treated Banat unfairly compared with other Reichskommissariats. Sepp Janko's regime also attempts to exploit and raid their surrounding neighbors. With the chaos ravaging in the Balkans, it is unsure if Sepp Janko will even survive."
