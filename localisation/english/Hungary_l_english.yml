 HUN_Istvan_Horthy:0 "István Horthy"
 POLITICS_HORTHY_DESC:0 "István Horthy, son of Miklós Horthy, former dictator of Hungary. Doesn’t have a set in stone military stance. He attempted to become Pro-German while still suppressing the Arrow Cross Party, which was the fascist and anti-semitic party of Hungary.\n\nSomehow through all the chaos, he manages to maintain a positive figure by the common population, supported by many Catholic churches. But the suppression by the ACP could threaten the stability of Hungary, and with Romania willing to go to war over Northern Transylvania, it is uncertain if the safety of Hungary is secured."
