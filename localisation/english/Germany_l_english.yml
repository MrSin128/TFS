 shadow_of_the_ss:0 "Shadow of the SS"
 shadow_of_the_ss_desc:0 "The SS was a notorious organisation in Germany. In WW2, they fought the bravest, but were also the most evil. Hitler trusted Himmler and the SS, but after the war genocide shut down, and SS became the biggest threat to Hitler’s rule. Now, words of a coup are spreading."
 thousand_years_reich:0 "Thousand Years Reich"
 thousand_years_reich_desc:0 "The word “Thousand Years Reich” was the dream of the Nazi party and the Germans. However, after World War Two, the new generation rejected the Aryan identity and formed underground societies against Nazism. Will the Nazis prevail in the end? Or will they face punishment?"
 eternal_total_war:0 "Eternal Total War"
 eternal_total_war_desc:0 "Although Germany technically won WW2, the enemy of Russia hasn't surrendered yet. The USSR still has an active force, even if weak and disorganised. Goebbels said that "There will be total war forever until the Russian surrender!”, and that quote rings true for the present. The economy was suited for constant pillaging, but it is definitely flawed at peace time."
 slavery_economy:0 "Slavery Economy"
 slavery_economy_desc:0 "After World War Two, the Holocaust ended, but the Nazis won't stop to enslave the 'subhuman’ Slavs and Jews. The Nazis set up factories in Ostland, Poland and Moskowien. However, these only worsened the economy, and the slaves are preparing for a revolt."
