 BUL_Simeon_II:0 "Simeon II"
 POLITICS_SIMEON_II_DESC:0 "After the sudden and saddening death of Tsar Boris III, his child son Simeon II took over as Tsar of Bulgaria. With the regency council of Bulgaria ruling for most of his childhood, young Simeon became bored and never cared for politics, leaving him uneducated on how to rule when becoming an adult. And for now, Simeon has no true power over Bulgaria, it’s just a false role set in by the Union of Bulgaria National Legions. It is uncertain whether Simeon will even truly hold a place in the Bulgarian government without having strings be pulled."
